This example AI parses youtube timestamp transcript clips to make them useful as AI inputs.  Input exerpts used are from interviews with pioneer Ilya Sutskever.

🌟 Ilya, a huge thank you for revolutionizing our world with your ML, Deep Learning, and RLHF wizardry! 🌍🤖 Watching your old videos with Lex from 4-5 years ago, it's amazing to witness how your master plan 📝 became a reality. 🎉 Congrats, mate! 🥳 For all of us daily programmers, AGI enthusiasts, and advanced science explorers, you've become a symbol of persistence 💪 and genius 🧠 in the field. Keep rockin' it and inspiring us all! 🎸🚀😁


1. ML:
2. Theoretically optimal hypothesis regarding short programs
3. The shortest program that fits training data is the best possible generalization.

1. RL:
2. We figure out what the reward is by observation
3. We reward ourselves - it is our interpretation of our senses
4. There is only one true reward in life: existence vs. non-existence
